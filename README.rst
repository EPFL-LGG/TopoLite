TopoLite
=========


.. begin_brief_description

TopoLite is a cross-platform tool for creating topological interlocking shell structures. It supports surface tiling, contact detection, globally interlocking verification, rigid body equilibrium, and topological interlocking block generation. Please refer to our 2019 Siggraph Asia paper(https://lgg.epfl.ch/publications/2019/Topological_Interlocking/index.php).
